Frontend Mentor Challenge.

Hi there! Thanks for viewing my solution :)

I have a few questions:

1 - I spent most of my time struggling to fit the image into the card itself. May I know when do I use "auto", "inherit", or use a hard-coded value for the length or width of an image?

2 - I treated the avatar image, text and arrow as a single flexbox container. Is there a way I can align the text without using negative margin?

3 - How may I improve my code?

Thanks for replying!
